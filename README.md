# üìä Stock Sequence Modeling

A comprehensive framework for analyzing and modeling stock trading sequences using feature extraction, rule-based and deep learning strategies, clustering, and advanced evaluation methods. This project integrates both classic quantitative models and modern machine learning to build robust trading systems.

## üß™ Data Requirements

Place historical daily stock CSV files under the `./time-series-data/` directory.  
Each CSV should be named like `AAPL_data.csv` and include the following columns:

```csv
Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
```

## Environment Setup
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate stock-modeling
```
